Histograms
- A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggplot2movies)
# loading ggplot2
# loading movies data sests for Histograms
head(movies)
```
```{r}
pl <- ggplot(movies, aes(rating)) 
print(pl + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1))
```
```{r}
print(pl + geom_histogram(aes(fill = ..count..), binwidth = 0.1))
```
```{r}
print(pl + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, col = 'blue', fill= '#f592e1'))
```
